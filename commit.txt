# SQL Server Practice Problems

Welcome to my personal learning project focused on SQL Server.

This repository is dedicated to collecting real-world SQL Server problems and solving them using optimized queries and best practices.  
Each problem is based on real scenarios I encounter during my studies or while exploring common challenges developers and DBAs face.

## 📘 Purpose

This is a self-learning project. I search for SQL-related problems, analyze them, and document solutions to improve my skills in:

- Writing efficient SQL queries
- Understanding SQL Server internals
- Optimizing performance
- Practicing database design and troubleshooting

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Joins and subqueries
- Aggregation and grouping
- Index optimization
- Query performance tuning
- Stored procedures and functions
- Data integrity and constraints

## 📁 Structure

Each folder or file in this repo includes:

- A **problem statement**
- One or more **solution attempts**
- Additional **notes** or **references** if needed

## ✅ Example Format

```sql
-- Problem: Retrieve all customers who haven't placed an order in the last 6 months

-- Solution:
SELECT c.CustomerName
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;

-- Notes: Using LEFT JOIN and filtering inside the ON clause ensures accuracy.
